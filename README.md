A micro framework which modernizes WordPress as a CMS development by providing tools to implement MVC and more.

Integration is incremental - you can use it only on the pages you want or on all pages.

If you've used Laravel, Slim or Symfony and miss the control over the request+response flow in WordPress - WP Emerge is definitely for you.
