## Development setup

1. Fork this repository.
1. Open up your theme directory in your terminal of choice.
1. Clone your fork e.g. `git clone git@github.com:your-username/wpemerge.git wpemerge`.
1. Run `cd wpemerge/ && composer install`.
1. Run `mkdir ../wpemerge-dev && cd ../wpemerge-dev`.
1. Run `printf '<?php\n' > web.php && printf '<?php\n' > admin.php && printf '<?php\n' > ajax.php`.
1. Open up your theme's `functions.php` file in your editor and add the following lines at the top:
    ```php
    use WPEmerge\Facades\WPEmerge;

    require_once( 'wpemerge/vendor/autoload.php' );

    add_action( 'init', function() {
        session_start(); // required only if you use Flash and OldInput
    } );

    WPEmerge::bootstrap( [
        'routes'              => [
            'web'   => __DIR__ . '/wpemerge-dev/web.php',
            'admin' => __DIR__ . '/wpemerge-dev/admin.php',
            'ajax'  => __DIR__ . '/wpemerge-dev/ajax.php',
        ],
    ] );
    ```
1. To make sure everything is running correctly, open up the new `wpemerge-dev/web.php` file and add this:
    ```php
    <?php
    use WPEmerge\Facades\Route;

    Route::get()
        ->url( '/' )
        ->handle( function () {
            return App::output( 'Hello World!' );
        } );
    ```
1. Now open up your site's homepage and if everything is setup correctly it should read `Hello World!`.
